The Crowbar Framework (https://github.com/dellcloudedge/crowbar) was developed by the Dell CloudEdge Solutions Team (http://dell.com/openstack) as a OpenStack installer (http://OpenStack.org) but has evolved as a much broader function tool. 
A Barclamp is a module component that implements functionality for Crowbar.  Core barclamps operate the essential functions of the Crowbar deployment mechanics while other barclamps extend the system for specific applications.

* This functonality of this barclamp DOES NOT stand alone, the Crowbar Framework is required * 

About this barclamp
-------------------

KEITH: This branch consists of minor changes to support use of an external MySQL server via the MySQL barclamp.

Current known issues:

* The mysql server node should be supplied by the node[:nova][:db][:dbserver] attribute, which is passed through crowbar via json data into chef. This data point is manually configured, and the value should be the FQDN of the MySQL master node you're talking to. This does not work! There's a bug somewhere that results in local cookbook attributes being written to the node instead of role attributes supplied by Chef. The role attributes are there, but on the node you onlys see the defaults defined in the attributes file.

* Likewise, the db password, which should be autogenerated at runtime by the nova::mysql recipe, is not working. When I call it, I get a ruby object ID instead. This is my bug inside this barclamp that I need to resolve. In the meantime, I've hardwired a password as an override attribute in the default attributes file.
